PL/SQL FINAL PROJECT

PROJECT: Attendance Risk Detection System
1. Introduction
The Attendance Risk Detection System is a PL/SQL based solution designed for hospitals and clinics to identify and manage patients who are at high risk of missing their scheduled appointments. By detecting potential no shows in advance, healthcare facilities can reduce congestion, improve scheduling efficiency, and optimize resource allocation.

2. Problem Definition
Healthcare facilities commonly experience high numbers of missed appointments. These no shows create challenges such as:
•	Long waiting times for other patients
•	Inefficient use of doctors and staff
•	Overcrowded waiting areas
•	Poor resource planning
The lack of automated tools to predict no show risks often results in last minute schedule changes and reduced operational efficiency.

3. Context of the System
The system is designed to operate within hospital and clinic environments, specifically in departments responsible for appointment scheduling and patient flow coordination. It relies on appointment data, patient visit history, and attendance patterns. PL/SQL triggers, procedures, and functions analyze past patient behavior and automatically assign a risk score.
4. Target Users
The system benefits:
•	Reception and appointment desk staff – for improved scheduling
•	Hospital administrators – for managing patient flow and clinic load
•	Clinical operations managers – for strategic planning
•	Healthcare providers – for better time management

5. Project Goals
The key objectives of this system include:
•	Detect patients who frequently miss appointments
•	Assign a real time no show risk score
•	Support informed scheduling decisions
•	Reduce congestion in hospitals and clinics
•	Improve patient throughput and operational efficiency
•	Provide a base for further BI (Business Intelligence) analytics

6. System Description
The Attendance Risk Detection System is built using PL/SQL and Oracle database components.
System Features:
•	Patient and appointment records stored in Oracle tables
•	Automated triggers recording missed appointments
•	Functions calculating patient no show probabilities
•	Procedures updating risk levels
•	Dashboard ready output tables for BI integration
Process Summary:
1.	Patient schedules an appointment
2.	The system checks historic attendance patterns
3.	PL/SQL functions assign a risk score
4.	Staff are alerted about high risk patients
5.	BI dashboards visualize long term trends

7. Business Intelligence (BI) Potential
The system provides strong BI opportunities, including:
Example Analytics:
•	No show trends over time
•	Visualization of high risk patient groups
•	Department level congestion analysis
•	Predictive graphs for expected daily appointment turnout
•	KPIs such as overall no show rate, reduction achieved, peak hours
These insights enable strategic decision making and improved patient management.
